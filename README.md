<h1>Final Proposal:</h1>

<h2>Background</h2>
<p>You're on your way home after work/school and you're hungry, but what do you eat?  Most meals take less than 30 minutes to prepare which is less than the wait time for most delivery options.  But even then, it is easy to eat unhealthy.  Based on a persons activity, there is a formula to determine the required caloric intake in a day.  You can easily log into our app, find your recommended caloric intake, and choose a healthy meal option which will display the ingredients you can pick up on your way home!  Funny thing, I was on my way home today and I even overheard a couple asking one another what they should make for dinner!  If my app was up and running, I'd say, EatEZ and visit EatEZ.com!
</p>

<h2>Functionality & MVPs</h2>

<p>In EatEZ, users will be able to:
</p>

<p>{ 4-6 core features or functionalities of your project }
</p>

<p>- A way to determine your daily caloric intake
</p>
<p>- Possibly a calculator to convert that into required macro nutrients
</p>
<p>- Filters for macro nutrients
</p>
<p>- Filters for your favorite type of cuisine
</p>

<p>In addition, this project will include:
</p>

<p>{ 2-4 other aspects of your project, including instructions & README }
</p>
<p>- If I have time, I would like to add a BMI calculator (either link or on the page itself)
</p>
<p>- I would like to incorporate infinte scroll
</p>

<h2>Technologies, Libraries, APIs</h2>

<p>I will be using the Edamam API.  This is an API whos free version allows you to look up 100 recipes at a time and returns things like ingredients, types of cuisine, calories, etc.  The drawback is that the free version doesn't have unlimited access to their database.  On the plus side, it is enough to create a working prototype of this app that I think will help a lot of people make healthy eating options.  I also might using d3 to render a graph of the macro nutrients in each recipe if I am able to get access to that data.
</p>

<h2>Implementation Timeline</h2>

<p>Here you will detail what you hope to get done each day for this project. It serves as a roadmap for the upcoming week. You'll have the following days to work on this project:
</p>

<p>Friday Afternoon & Weekend: 
Start by researching the API and be able to Parse the data
</p>
<p>Monday: 
Create the HTML skeleton for the page
</p>
<p>Tuesday: 
Write the javascript to make the page interactive
</p>
<p>Wednesday: 
Work on styling
</p>
<p>Thursday Morning: 
Tweaking as necessary
</p>
